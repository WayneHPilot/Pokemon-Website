            <p>Hi there! You see that guy on the left? Yeah that's me!</p>
            <p>My name is Wayne, I'm a computer science graduate and a full stack developer in training!</p>
            <p>This is my first website, and I based it on Pokémon, because that is what really got me into gaming and considered as my first hobby!</p>
            <p>Ever since getting into Pokémon, I haven't stopped with either the games or the TCG.</p>
            <P>My top 6 Pokémon!</P>
            <li>Charizard</li>
            <li>Mewtwo</li>
            <li>Garchomp</li>
            <li>Blaziken</li> 
            <li>Jolteon</li>
            <li>Scizor</li><br>
            <p>Other than Pokémon, I also enjoy Yu-Gi-Oh!, some of my other hobbies include going to the gym, going on walks,
                playing games either on my own or with friends, watching anime and movies, or I'm playing either an online DND campaign
                or I'm at my local card shop playing either Pokémon TCG, Yu-Gi-Oh TCG or a DND campaign.</p>
